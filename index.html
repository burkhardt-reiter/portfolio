                <p>I am a builder of systems and networks and I love solving problems with flexible solutions. My career goal is to work with a team of similarly passionate people who are concerned with details and producing maintainable code.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Golf Score Card : What the fuck did I do? ...Lester, are we still cops? OK, I was just checking. ...Explain it to me again, because I tell ya, I think I'm a smart guy, but this shit makes my head hurt. ...This kid, whose mama went to the trouble to christen him Omar Isaiah Betts... You know, he forgets his jacket, his nose starts running and some asshole, instead of giving him a Kleenex, he calls him "Snot". So he's Snot forever. Doesn't seem fair.</li>
                    <li><em>Raindrop Zen Generator: </em>See, that's what I don't get about the drug thing. Why can't you sell the shit and walk the fuck away? You know what I mean? Everything else in this country gets sold without people shooting each other behind it. ...I gotta tell you, Lester, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but I can see why Daniels cringed every time you opened your fucking mouth. You're a supervisor's nightmare. ...Well, you know what they say: "stupid criminals make stupid cops". I'm proud to be chasing this guy.</li>
                    <li><em>Rhythmicon generator: </em>Nah, it's not just that. It's like, I went to meet her once; she was in a hotel room on the top floor. I punched the button on the elevator and it doesn't even go there. You gotta have some kind of special key to even get to that special fucking floor. So I go to the front desk, some sneering fuck calls upstairs, gives me permission to go and get laid. I listen to the shit she talks about and it's the first time in my life I feel like a fucking doormat. Like anyone else with any smarts would do something else with his life, you know? Earn money, or ... get elected. Like I'm just a breathing machine for my fucking dick. I'm serious; I'm the smartest asshole in three districts and she looks at me like I'm some stupid fuck playing some stupid game for stupid penny-ante stakes. She fucking looks through me, Kima.</li>
